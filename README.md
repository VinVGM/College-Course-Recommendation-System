A sophisticated AI-powered course recommendation system that helps engineering students find relevant online courses from major learning platforms based on their college curriculum. The system uses advanced keyword extraction and matching algorithms to provide personalized course recommendations.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Recommendations from edX, Coursera, and Udemy
- **Branch-Specific Curricula**: Support for Electronics and Computer Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, and VLSI Design
- **AI-Powered Matching**: Uses KeyBERT for intelligent keyword extraction and course matching
- **Material Sharing**: Community-driven platform for sharing course materials and resources
- **Smart Recommendations**: Ranked results based on keyword similarity scores
- **Price Information**: Course pricing details for Udemy and edX courses
- **Direct Links**: Direct access to recommended courses with proper URLs

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit web application with intuitive UI
- **Backend**: Python-based recommendation engine
- **AI Engine**: KeyBERT model for keyword extraction and matching
- **Data Layer**: CSV datasets containing course information and keywords
- **Matching Algorithm**: Custom keyword-based similarity scoring system

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/College-Course-Recommendation-System.git
cd College-Course-Recommendation-System
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📦 Dependencies

The main dependencies include:

- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **KeyBERT**: AI-powered keyword extraction
- **NeatText**: Text preprocessing and cleaning
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Base64**: Encoding utilities

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Course Selection
- Choose your engineering branch from the dropdown
- Select a course provider (edX, Coursera, or Udemy)
- Pick a specific college course from your curriculum

### 2. AI-Powered Matching
- The system extracts keywords from your selected college course
- Uses KeyBERT to generate relevant keywords and phrases
- Matches these keywords with pre-processed course data from online platforms

### 3. Smart Recommendations
- Courses are ranked by keyword similarity scores
- Results include course titles, URLs, and pricing information
- Direct links to course pages for easy access

### 4. Material Sharing
- Community-contributed learning materials for each course
- Add new material links to help fellow students
- Access shared resources for enhanced learning

## 📊 Supported Engineering Branches

- **Electronics and Computer Engineering (ECM)**
- **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)**
- **Electronics Engineering: VLSI Design (VLSI)**

## 🌐 Course Providers

- **edX**: Academic courses from top universities
- **Coursera**: Professional and academic courses
- **Udemy**: Practical skill-based courses

## 🔧 Configuration

The system uses several CSV datasets located in the `dataset/` folder:

- `ecm_curriculum.csv`: Electronics and Computer Engineering curriculum
- `ece_curriculum.csv`: Electronics and Communication Engineering curriculum
- `vlsi__curriculum.csv`: VLSI Design curriculum
- `udemy_courses.csv`: Udemy course database
- `edx_courses.csv`: edX course database
- `coursea_data.csv`: Coursera course database
- `materials.csv`: Community-shared materials
